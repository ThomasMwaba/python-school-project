# This program was written in Python using Object-Oriented programming and when the object SchoolProgram() is executed, the arguments are initialized.
# When the method schedule() is executed it prompts the user to enter a specific activity of the day which then displays the times when that program is scheduled to #happen and when the method foods() also prompts the user to select the foods they desire to eat from the available foods and then appends them to the list which saves #them to student's foods.text.
#The intention behind selecting these specific foods is to encourage students to eat foods that are nutritious and provide memory-improving and brain-boosting chlorine, #improve cognitive function and the list goes on.
